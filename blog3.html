			<h1>Process:Pratt Library Redesign</h1>
			Last week I finished the last of the user research so I begin designing. 
			I designed Page Description Diagrams that distinguished the difference between
			high, medium and low level priority items for each of the 6 pages I am designing. 
			Based on my user research, the highest priority item was constant accessibility 
			of the Search Bar. Another high priority item is the Location & Hours Page. After
			selecting items' priorities, I designed rough wireframes for where information would
			be located on each page. I then made a style tile that depicted the aesthetic direction
			I want to go towards which will be clean, simple and minimal.
