			<h1>Process:Pratt Library Redesign</h1>
			Because I was somewhat behind from last weeks assignment, I just now began to code my website this week so I was
			caught trying to not only add the core, basic elements to my website but also include stylistic details. It was a 
			challenge and I still am left with a few kinks and questions. I am still left questioning how to handle my nav bar
			and how to have it collapse and expand. I did not think while designing my flats how complicated and challenging the
			coding would be for it. But nonetheless I have made progress, while it may be slow progress and while continue to 
			code this page for the next week.
