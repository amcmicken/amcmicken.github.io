			There are a number of things that I like and want to learn how to recreate from this website.
			First off, I noticed that the design is responsive when you adjust the width of the window. 
			For example the row of thumbnails adjusts from 3 to 2 when you shorten the width of the window. 
			I am also interested in the delay of opacity/transparency when you scroll up and down
			from the thumbnails. What I am most intrigued by is how when you hover over either "Design" or
			"Development" the entire screen either whites or blacks out. I like how simple and striking it is.
