			<h1><a href="http://www.il-ho.com">Il-Ho Jung</a></h1>
			Il-Ho Jung has a lot of interesting transitions and animations that he uses and I think are very effective.
			When moving from page to page he has a nice shutter (or close blind) effect. He uses the mark of the diamond
			repeatedly on his website. For example the navigation at the bottom of the screen as well as in the middle of
			the screen when moving from project to project. Also, when you hover over that middle diamond a large diamond
			appears and inside of it is a closeup preview of the project to come. I think because his images are full bleed
			he is able ot play around with and have more fun with details like transitions and navigation while still allowing
			the site to not look cluttered or overdone.
