			<h1><a href="http://where-you-are.com">Where You Are</a></h1>
			Where You Are is an interesting site that is promoting a book including
			16 artists, writers, thinkers, and their personal maps. The site is set
			up horizontally and breaks the edges of the browser. You are encouraged
			to click and drag around to explore everything. What I found most
			intriguiging is the fact that you can see where someone else is reading
			because a yellow bordered box pops up. I think that is such an interesting
			and fitting idea for this particular work.
