			<h1>Process:Pratt Library Redesign</h1>
			This week I began creating browser-based wireframes for my 6 pages of the Pratt Library. 
			I began to create with Bootstrap components from what we learned in class, however I 
			switched over to UXPin due to the complications that arose with Bootstrap. For my wireframes
			my goal was to just place all of the elements on to each of the pages without designing them.
			I just wanted to see the functionality. The sidenav is an important element of my pages because
			it is the core of the navigation through my site. An interesting side note that helps with 
			functionality is that you will be able to compress and expand the nav on the left side.
