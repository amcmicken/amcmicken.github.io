			<h1>Pratt Library Redesign Process Week 1</h1>
			I am currrently in week 1 of the Pratt Library Redesign. So far I have been delving into the user research,
			competitive analysis, and the creative brief. No "designing" as been done quite yet.  In my user research
			I interviewed 5 MICA students, my target audience, about their thoughts on the Pratt Library and then made
			3 personas based off of them to make a well rounded experience of who would be using the site. I then made 
			a competitive analysis sheet and picked multiple criterias for the website to encompass. I then found 5
			competing websites that fulfilled the criteria. Afterwards I ended with compiling all of my research into a
			creative brief.
