			<h1><a href="http://www.anitype.com">Anitype</a></h1>
			Anitype is a cool project/website that I found on itsnicethat.com that asks the question "what if letters could move?"
			The creater, Jono Brandel, is a designer and developer at Google. Anitype allows the user to animate every letter 
			in the alphabet as well as special characters. I think this project is great because it opens up the world to how
			one can use animated type in a webbased platform. The site takes you to a page where you actually get to manipulate
			the raw javascript itself and preview the animation. I played around a bit with it but I don't know enough javascript
			to really know what I am doing. I would like to learn what each of the functions means in the code and be able to
			create my own unique animated letter form.
