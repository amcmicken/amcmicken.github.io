			<h1>Process:Pratt Library Redesign</h1>
			This week I have made a lot of headway in terms of the coding as well as made tweaks to my design as well. I found the
			Google Nexus Nav Bar that works great for my site. It was very complicated to figure out how ot incorporate in into
			my already existing page. I am actually still working on getting the nav bar to fit perfectly into each page. I also
			made some great headway with my hovering of a book image. I have almost worked all of the kinks out of that as well.
			I do still have a few pages that I need to design so while I am behind schedule I am still hopeful that I can finish
			in time for the March 4th deadline.
